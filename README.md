- ALL_NATIONS_BATTING_STATS.csv, ALL_NATIONS_BOWLING_STATS.csv, FINAL_ALL_PLAYERS_ALL_categories.csv, SPORTS_ANALYTICS.pbix - These files are sufficient to view the PowerBI dashboard.
- In the jupyter_notebooks folder I have uploaded the jupyter notebooks in which I have written codes using python to extract the raw data which is in 'json_string' format and convert into a suitable dataframe and finally into a **.csv** file.
- I have not uploaded the original datasets, kindly copy and paste the original datasets into the **jupyter_notebooks** folder and run the notebooks.
